## Summary

Hello there! Vincenzo here.

As my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincenzo-garambone/) profile summary says, I am an experienced Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the education/training industry. 
Skilled in Android, HTML5, Software Analysis & Design, Java and Game Development using Unity3D.

I currently work as Software Developer & Instructor at [Elis](http://www.elis.org), Rome.
When I'm not at work, I usually try to to have a good read, listen to (and play) music, enjoy a movie or get into serious gaming.

*Hope you enjoy this blog.*
