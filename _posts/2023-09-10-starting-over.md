<sub>Sunset in the Wadi-Rum Desert. Totally unrelated, just very pretty. Terrible picture by me.</sub>

So, after a long hiatus from writing/maintaining this website, here I am again. The main reason for this break still remains unknown, when I wrote my first posts and made this website I was sure I could note anything I was doing at the time, whether tech-related or from my personal life.
Needless to say, that didn't happen over the course of multiple years.

This post comes with the update of my [about page](/about) which was way too update to let anyone know what I'm up to. As of today, since I have the privilege of spending more time on my own personal projects, posting more updates, articles or just thoughts will likely become something more common.

Ciao!
